// unbufferedRegistration is similar to bufferedRegistration but does not buffer
// events in publish directly. Rather, when caught up, it send events directly
// to the sender, depending on the BufferedStream to be non-blocking. As a
// result, it does not require a long-lived goroutine to volley event when
// reading from raft.
//
// Note that UnbufferedRegistration needs to ensure that events sent to
// BufferedStream from the processor during a running catchup scan are sent to
// the client in order. To achieve this, events from catch-up scans are send
// using UnbufferedSend. While the catch-up scan is ongoing, live updates
// delivered via publish() are temporarily buffered in catchUpBuf to hold them
// until catch-up scan is complete. After the catch-up scan is done, we know
// that catch-up scan events have been sent to grpc stream successfully. The
// catch-up buffer is then drained by our hopefully short lived output loop
// goroutine. Once the catchup buffer is fully drained publish begins sending to
// the buffered sender directly.
//
// All errors are delivered to this registration via Disonnect() which is
// non-blocking. Disconnect sends an error to the stream and invokes any
// necessary cleanup.
//
// unbufferedRegistration is responsible for allocating and draining memory
// catch-up buffer.
