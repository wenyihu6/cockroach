# This test verifies that the allocator correctly handles IO overload by
# avoiding placement of replicas on stores that exceed the IO threshold. It
# sets up a 5-node cluster where store 5 has an IO threshold of 1, causing it
# to be considered overloaded and excluded from replica placement decisions.
# It is expected that s5 will start with 0 replicas and stay at 0 replicas for
# the duration of the test.
