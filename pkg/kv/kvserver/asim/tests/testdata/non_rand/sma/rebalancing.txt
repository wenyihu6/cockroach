# This test verifies that the allocator can rebalance qps load across a 7-node
# cluster. mma-only fails here since it doesn't balance based on leases.
# TODO(tbg): this test works because the default rebalancing objective in asim
# was accidentally left as 'qps' (even though we use 'cpu' in production).
# When the default changes, this test needs to override the setting and probably
# rename the test to specify that it's about qps rebalancing in particular,
# which otherwise sees little explicit testing.
