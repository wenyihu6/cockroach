# This test can now roughly equalize both cpu and write bandwidth. It didn't
# use to be able to do this, because the highest cpu node had the lowest write
# bandwidth and vice versa, so neither was able to shed to the other. The
# ignoreLevel logic in rebalanceStores with the grace duration to start
# shedding more aggressively and other related changes have made this much
# better.
