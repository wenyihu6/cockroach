# The test sets up a 9-node cluster where every store initiallyhas the same

# s1 handles significant cpu load, s2,s3 handle small follower cpu load, while

# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance both leases and replicas to
# achieve more even cpu and write distribution across all nodes.
