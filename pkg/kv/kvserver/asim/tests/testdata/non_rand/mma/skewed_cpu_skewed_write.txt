# This test verifies the allocator's behavior with opposing CPU and write load
# distributions. The test sets up a 6-node cluster where s1-s3 handle high-CPU
# read traffic and s4-s6 handle high-write traffic. Initially, all leases are on
# s1 and s4.
#
# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance both cpu and write load across
# all stores, with mma achieving better results than sma.
#
# This test can now roughly equalize both cpu and write bandwidth. It didn't
# use to be able to do this, because the highest cpu node had the lowest write
# bandwidth and vice versa, so neither was able to shed to the other. The
# ignoreLevel logic in rebalanceStores with the grace duration to start
# shedding more aggressively and other related changes have made this much
# better.
