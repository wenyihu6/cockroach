# This test verifies allocator's behavior in a heterogeneous cluster where nodes
# have different CPU capacities. The test sets up a 3-node cluster with nodes n1
# and n2 having 8vcpu capacity each, and node n3 having 16vcpu capacity. It
# creates 200 ranges evenly distributed across all stores and generates a
# read-only workload.
#
# Expected outcome: mma should balance cpu load based on cpu utilization
# percentage rather than absolute cpu nanos. However, both mma and sma currently
# balance on absolute cpu-nanos. n3 should handle more load due to its higher
# capacity, but the current implementation doesn't account for this. This is
# tracked in issue: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/153777.
