# This test verifies that the allocator can rebalance replicas and leases when
# there is high cpu load imbalance across the cluster. The test sets up a 10-node
# cluster with two distinct workloads: one evenly distributed across all nodes,
# and another high-cpu workload initially concentrated on only the first few nodes
# due to skewed placement. The second workload has significantly higher cpu cost
# per op, creating cpu imbalance.
#
# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance both replicas and leases to
# distribute the high-cpu workload more evenly across all 10 nodes.
